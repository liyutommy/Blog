This semester I took a software development course, and I feel that I have enough capability to do some projects with the knowledge I have learned. Therefore, I learned React, JavaScript, and GatsbyJS by studying their documentation during fall break to build my blog. I will use TypeScript to improve my blog later. For me as a newbie, there is still a long way to go on the road of technology.
